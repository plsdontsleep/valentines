# Cozy Pixel World — For Your Girlfriend

Open [index.html](index.html) in a browser to view the interactive site locally.

What it includes:

To run:
   Example (Python 3):

 1. Double-click `index.html` or serve the folder with any static server.
python -m http.server 8000

# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

If you want, I can:
- Add personalized messages or more memory cards
 Notes:
 - The initial page is `index.html` with a big greeting. Click the button twice — the second click opens a small `player.html` popup and then navigates to `page2.html` which holds the rest of the site.
 - Place `music.mp3` in the project root so the popup can play it.
- Create downloadable packaged zip or deploy it to GitHub Pages
- Add animations or pixel-sprite frames for more cat actions
